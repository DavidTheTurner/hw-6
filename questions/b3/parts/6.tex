\question{(B3.6)}{
    Prove that for {\it any\/} matrix $A\in \mathrm{M}_n(\reals)$,
    not necessarily  invertible, there is a convergent sequence
    $(A_k)_{k\geq 1}$ of {\it invertible\/} matrices $A_k\in
    \mathbf{GL}(n, \reals)$ whose limit is $A$.
    To prove this, it is convenient to use the
    Frobenius norm or the operator $2$-norm (the spectral norm).
    You need to construct a sequence of  invertible matrices $A_k$ such that
    \[
        \lim_{k \mapsto \infty} \norme{A - A_k} = 0.
    \]\\
    \hint
    Use a convenient factorization of $A$.
